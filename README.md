Exploratory Data Analysis of Dementia-Related Data
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of dementia-related data to uncover patterns and insights that can aid in understanding the condition better. By examining various demographic, clinical, and cognitive factors, the EDA aims to identify key indicators and trends associated with dementia onset and progression. The analysis includes visualizations and statistical summaries to highlight significant relationships and potential risk factors. This comprehensive EDA serves as a foundational step for developing predictive models and informing future research on dementia prevention and management.
